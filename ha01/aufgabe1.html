            <div>Welcome to my Blog!</div>
            <div>Hi, my name is Goldon Lamsay, also known as the Cursing Chef. I took a couple classes on Web development and had to try it out. Web development turns out to be as simple as making the perfect scrambled egg. At least for a five-and-a-half Michelin Star chef like myself.<div>
            <div>I will regularly make more posts like this, some will be recipes of last night's dinner, some will just be me rambling about stuff. God, I love the div tag! I definitely don't know what it's supposed to do, but it is like MSG: everything feels better with it. Stay updated, subscribe and like and follow me on twitter.</div>

                <div>6 oz pasta (e.g. Spaghetti)</div>

                <div>1 tsp. freshly cracked black pepper</div>
                <div>3/4 cup finely grated Parmesan</div>

                <div>Meanwhile, melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a Dutch oven or other large pot or skillet over medium heat. Add pepper and cook, swirling pan, until toasted, about 1 minute.</div>
                <div>Add ½ cup reserved pasta water to skillet and bring to a simmer. Add pasta and remaining butter. Reduce heat to low and add Grana Padano, stirring and tossing with tongs until melted. Remove pan from heat; add Pecorino, stirring and tossing until cheese melts, sauce coats the pasta, and pasta is al dente. (Add more pasta water if sauce seems dry.) Transfer pasta to warm bowls and serve.</div>
